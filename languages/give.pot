msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:376
msgid "Give is driven by it's powerful form building features. But it is not simply a \"form\". From the \"Add Form\" page you'll be able to choose how and where you want to receive your donations. You'll be able to set the donation amounts. You even get to choose whether you want to create a whole page for your form, or embed it on a different page of your site."

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:397

msgid "STEP 3: Landing Page or Shortcode Mode?"
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:408
msgid "Every form you create in Give can either become it's own stand-alone page, or it can be inserted into any other page or post throughout your site as a Shortcode."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:410
msgid "You can choose these different modes by going to the \"Form Content\" section. From there, you can choose to add content before or after the Donation form on a page, or if you choose \"None\" perhaps you want to instead use the shortcode. You can find the shortcode in the top right column directly under the Publish/Save button. This feature gives you the most amount of flexibility with controlling your content on your website all within the same page."

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:427
msgid "STEP 4: Configure Your Display Options"
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:429
