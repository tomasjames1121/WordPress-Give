# Give Unit Tests [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/impress-org/give.png?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.org/impress-org/give)

This folder contains instructions and test code for Give PHPUnit testing.

## Initial Setup

1) Install [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/) by following their [installation guide](https://phpunit.de/getting-started.html). If you've installed it correctly, this should display the version:

    `$ phpunit --version`

2) Install WordPress and the WP Unit Test library using the `install.sh` script located in `give/tests/bin/` directory. Change to the plugin root directory and type:


    $ tests/bin/install.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-password> [db-host]

Sample usage:

    $ tests/bin/install.sh give_tests root root

**Important**: The `<db-name>` database will be created if it doesn't exist and all data will be removed during testing.

For more information on how to write PHPUnit Tests, see [PHPUnit's Website](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html).

Are you using Pressmatic? Check out this [helpful article](https://tommcfarlin.com/unit-testing-with-pressmatic/) by Tom McFarlin on setting up PHPUnit on Pressmatic. 

## Running Tests

Simply change to the plugin root directory and type:

    $ phpunit

The tests will execute and you'll be presented with a summary. Code coverage documentation is automatically generated as HTML in the `tmp/coverage` directory.

You can run specific tests using `--filter` followed by the class name and method to test:

    $ phpunit --filter Tests_Templates::test_get_donation_form

A text code coverage summary can be displayed using the `--coverage-text` option:

    $ phpunit --coverage-text


## Writing Tests

* Each test method should cover a single method or function with one or more assertions
* A single method or function can have multiple associated test methods if it's a large or complex method
* Use the test coverage HTML report (under `tmp/coverage/index.html`) to examine which lines your tests are covering and aim for 100%Â® coverage
* Prefer `assertsEquals()` where possible as it tests both type & equality
* Only methods prefixed with `test` will be run so use helper methods liberally to keep test methods small and reduce code duplication.
* Use data providers where possible. Read more about data providers [here](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html#writing-tests-for-phpunit.data-providers).
* Filters persist between test cases so be sure to remove them in your test method or in the `tearDown()` method.

## Automated Tests

Tests are automatically run with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) for each commit and pull request.
