Democratizing Generosity - Bringing everyone the power to accept donations freely on their WordPress website.

== Description ==

Give is a robust plugin that allows you to accept donations on your WordPress powered website. Prior to Give there's was no single go to solution for accepting donations on WordPress. Your options included using an e-commerce platform or a forms plugin. The problem is that's not what they were built for. Sure there are a few other donation specific plugins out there, but not like Give.

= Simple and Pain Free Giving =

Give works great right in WordPress in a way that you're already familiar in working. Simply install the plugin and take the tour to get started. For new users, reviewing our videos and documentation is always a good idea to get an understanding of how the plugin works. If you run into any trouble, support is here to help.

= Zero Commission Charges =

We earn money by selling Add-on features, not from your Mission. Raised dollars go to support you cause. Period.

= Easy to Customize and Enhance =

Built by WordImpress, our plugins are built from the ground up to be intuitive and easy to use. Bundled with the plugin is a support team that is dedicated, fast to respond, and always willing to squash bugs and help troubleshoot.

= Contribute to Give =

This plugin is open source and we're always looking for more contributors. Whether you know another language, can code like no ones business, or just have an idea or suggestion, we would love your help and input. To contribute to Give please head over to our website or view/fork/watch the GitHub repository to learn more about what issues we're tackling and about the project.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Give, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Give" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
